Terms used in this assessment are as they were defined in the course material. <br />\r\n\r\n  <h3><strong> Organizational Theories Overview <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n  <h4><strong> Classical Theory <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Classical theory is characterized by views such as, 'the organization is a machine,' and includes sub-fields such as scientific management and bureaucratic theory. <\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Human Theory <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> While commonly known as neoclassical organizational theory, this document will use the term human theory. Human theory embodies the ideas of human resources, human relations, and participative management. Human theory is exemplified by organizations that ensure their employees feel comfortable and supported at work, and that their contributions are recognized. <\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Systems Theory <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Systems theory as used here refers to a combination of systems, contingency, and chaos theory. Overall, an organization that primarily embodies this theory will expect and plan for chaos and orient itself as if it exists within an ever-changing and evolving environment. <\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Culture Theory <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Culture theory embodies various organizational theories that emphasize the shared beliefs, values, and practices within an organization, shaping its identity and influencing behavior. Overall, an organization that primarily embodies such a view will ensure that the mission and vision of the organization are supported by various work systems and its members.<\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h3><strong> Leadership Styles Overview<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n  <h4><strong> Authoritarian Leadership <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Authoritarian leaders make decisions independently and tend to seek little input from group members. They expect strict compliance and often promote a hierarchical structure. While the word 'authoritarian' may have a negative connotation to many, ultimately, this style is embodied by leaders who lead the charge, making decisions and training organization members in highly specialized roles.<\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Democratic Leadership <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Democratic leaders encourage group participation in decision-making and value diverse opinions. They foster collaboration and create a sense of ownership among team members. This style is embodied by leaders who seek feedback, do not make decisions alone, and allow employees to be involved with the goals that they set. <\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Laissez-faire Leadership <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Laissez-faire (French for 'allow to do') leaders take a hands-off approach, providing minimal direction and allowing group members to make decisions. Leaders play a supportive role, ensuring employees have good training, guidance, and freedom. This style is embodied by leaders who are looking to build other leaders and provide natural and planned opportunities for employees to develop personally.  <\/p><br />\r\n\r\n  <h4><strong> Situational Leadership <\/strong><\/h4>\r\n  <p> Situational leaders adapt their style based on the needs of the team and the situation at hand. They may switch between authoritative, democratic, or laissez-faire approaches depending on different variables. This style is embodied by leaders who consider the landscape carefully before proceeding, ensuring that the chosen approach will meet the goals of the moment more comprehensively.  <\/p><br />\"\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  })\r\n  \r\n  \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n","type":"text"},{"name":"Shinyyyyyy.Rproj","content":"Version: 1.0\r\nProjectId: 0a23112c-f940-4ae6-96c6-47a2d704e2ba\r\n\r\nRestoreWorkspace: Default\r\nSaveWorkspace: Default\r\nAlwaysSaveHistory: Default\r\n\r\nEnableCodeIndexing: Yes\r\nUseSpacesForTab: Yes\r\nNumSpacesForTab: 2\r\nEncoding: UTF-8\r\n\r\nRnwWeave: Sweave\r\nLaTeX: pdfLaTeX\r\n","type":"text"}]
