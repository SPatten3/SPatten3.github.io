<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Analyzing Trends within Joseph Smith’s
Polygamy</h1>
<h4 class="author">Spencer Patten</h4>

<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(a.k.a. LDS Church or the Church), I often hear criticism of my faith’s
theology and history. I typically suspend my acceptance of such claims
until I perform my own research. One of the more common attacks is
regarding the character of the Church’s founder, Joseph Smith. Smith
claimed that God commanded him to institute the practice of plural
marriage, meaning the marrying of more than one wife. He often comes
under fire for this. For instance, it is assumed that each plural
marriage was treated as a typical marriage and were consummated.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of LDS and Non-LDS historians, we have a pretty
good idea with what happened in most of these plural marriages. Using
this historical data, we can assess different questions about Joseph
Smith’s Polygamy. By doing so, I hope first and foremost to uncover the
truth. I have the firm hope that the truth will show that Smith was a
reputable man, free from hypocrisy and acting within his cultural
context. Should the evidence indicate sexual immorality,</p>

<div id="index" class="section level2 tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">
<h2 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Structure and
Methodology</h2>
<div id="primary-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Primary Question</h3>
<p>The analysis will seek to answer the primary question:</p>
<p><strong>“Did Joseph Smith engage in questionable or inappropriate
actions through the practice of polygamy?”</strong></p>
<p>Six secondary questions will be analyzed by a visualization tools
such as a tables, bar charts, or density plots. If the visualizations
leave any questions, a statistical test such as a t test will be used to
further understand the truth. When answering each question, Smith will
be assumed innocent (i.e. within the law, adhering to societal norms,
etc.) until there is sufficient evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Because more than one statistical test will be performed, Bonferoni’s
method of test correction will be applied to lower the risk of type 1
error. Significance levels will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="outline" class="section level3">
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>In pursuit of an answer to this question, the following secondary
questions will be asked :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#pedo">Are any of Joseph Smith’s sexual relations
consistent with pedophilia?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#emma">Did Smith hide sexual realtionships from his
first wife, Emma?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#type">What is the relationship between the type of
sealing and evidence of sexuality?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#law">Despite the illegality of polygamy, was Smith
otherwise within local marriage laws?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#age">How do the ages of his brides compare to
contemporary marriage trends?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#diff">How do the age difference between him and his
wives compare to contemporary trends?</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>Historical data such as the names, ages, and other factors was
sourced from the work of Brian Hales. Observational data including the
strength of any evidence of sexual relations were not the author’s, but
sourced from the work of Brian Hales. The author reviewed the primary
and secondary historical evidences to determine whether Emma Smith was
aware of the plural marriages. All data regarding Joseph Smith’s
Polygamy was sourced from the various pages on Brian Hales’ website, <a
href="josephsmithspolygamy.org">josephsmithspolygamy.org</a>.</p>
<p>Data used from the 1850 US census was retrieved from the IPUMS
database<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The data set used was a random sample of
census records totaling 1% of the US population surveyed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="definition-of-pedophilia" class="section level3">
<h3>Definition of Pedophilia</h3>
<p>Because one of the questions being asked regards Smith showing
pedophilic tendencies, the term will be defined. Dictionaries
contemporary to Smith do not have the term, therefore a modern
definition will be used. This analysis will not seek to officially
diagnose anyone with any mental disorders. Any conclusions regarding
such will be, at most, observations regarding trends in the historical
record. For purposes of the analysis, a synthesis of the definitions
provided by the American Psychological Association and the American
Psychiatric Association for pedophilia will be used as the strictest
definition.</p>
<p>According to the American Psychological Association, pedophilia is “a
paraphilia in which sexual acts or fantasies involving prepubertal
children are the persistently preferred or exclusive method of achieving
sexual excitement<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.” The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Health Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric
Association, adds that the sexual acts or fantasies are “with a
prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger)<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.”</p>
<p>Taking a looser definition based on these criteria, the established
definition of pedophilia for this analysis will be, “any stand-alone or
repeated sexual relations with an individual or individuals below the
age of sixteen.” The intention behind expanding this definition is to
fit the definition within the moral intuitions and sensibilities of the
broader public.</p>

<div id="trends-within-smiths-marriages" class="section level2">
<h2>Trends within Smith’s Marriages</h2>
<p>With the data gathered, inferences and conclusions can be drawn when
we cross reference data such as type of sealing, historical evidence of
sexuality, the knowledge that his first wife, Emma, had, and such.</p>

<div id="pedo" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Are any of Joseph Smith’s
relations consistent with pedophilia?</h3>
<p>It is often and understandably inferred that two married individuals
will engage in sexual relations at some point. When it is learned that
Smith had several wives under 18, inferences such as this cause many to
assume he was having sexual relations with all of them.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The data suggests that there is no evidence that Smith engaged in
sexual relations with anyone under the age of 17. It does appear that
younger wives than average appear in the moderate and strong categories.

</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level4">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Given the <a href="#index">definition of pedophilia</a> set forth,
there is insufficient evidence to adopt the view that Smith had
pedophilic tendencies. There is no evidence that Smith met the criteria
of a pedophile.</p>
<p>Further study into the historical data can provide insight on a case
by case basis. For more information on the issue of Smith’s sealings to
young bride, <a

<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Did Smith hide sexual

<p>Especially during the early days of his practice of plural marriage,
Smith’s first wife Emma Hale was not made aware of the sealings he was
entering into. This has been pointed to as a betrayal of trust on
Smith’s part. The complex issue deserves historical analysis, but there
may be lessons to be learned from the statistics.</p>

<div id="conclusion-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>While Smith was not fully transparent with his first wife regarding
each and every plural wife, the historical data suggests that Emma was
aware of the vast majority of relationships where sexuality was possibly
occurring. The trends suggest that Smith was not hiding sexual
relationships from his first wife.</p>
<p>With that said, elsewhere there is evidence that Emma had difficulty
accepting the practice of polygamy. For more information on the subject,

<div id="type" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">What is the relationship
between the type of sealing and evidence of sexuality?</h3>
<p>Today in the LDS Church, the only sealings performed for the living
are time-and-eternity sealings. That is, a man and a wife are joined in
union for the rest of this life as well as in the next life. However, in
the early days of the church, this was not solely the case. Sealings
could be performed for time, time-and-eternity, or eternity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div id="graph" class="section level4">
<h4>Graph</h4>
<p>Sealings involving time would be treated as legal marriages are, but
eternity-only sealings would not. Given the LDS Church’s consistency in
teaching that sexual relations be within marriage, evidence that Smith
engaged in sexual relations within eternity-only sealings would imply
hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The following graph will display the evidence of sexuality, grouped
by the types of sealings.</p>
<p><img src="Polyg_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><br /></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>As type of sealing and historical evidence of sexuality are
juxtaposed, it becomes clear that the only relationships with stronger
evidence of sexuality (moderate to strong) were those which were treated
as legal marriages. Thus, there is enough evidence to conclude that
Smith was not violating the principles he taught and enforced.</p>
<p>It is likely that Smith viewed Time and Eternity sealings as being
legitimate marriages. Thus, he did withing those relationships what
married people do.</p>
<p><br /></p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="comparison-to-contemporary-trends" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparison to Contemporary Trends</h2>
<p>While modern moral sensibilities are violated when and adult man is
said to have slept with a teenager, the past is akin to a different
country. A comparison of social trends in Smith’s day may yield insight
into any deviance from modern trends.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div id="law" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Despite the illegality of
polygamy, was Smith otherwise within local marriage laws?</h3>
<p>The accusations that Smith was a pedophile primarily revolve around
his being sealed to 14 year old name Helen Mar Kimball. More on that can
be learned in <a
href="https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/helen-mar-kimball/">this
article</a>. If Smith’s marriages showed to be outside of Illinois
marriage laws, this would raise questions on his motives.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div id="table-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Table</h4>
<p>While the Church was in Illinois, the marriage laws stated that with
parental consent, anyone female as young as 14 years old female was able
to be married<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Without parental consent, a female must
have been 18 or older. While laws have changed much since then, in those
days, it would have been legal if Smith had permission from the
parents.</p>
<p>The following table lists each of Smith’s plural wives under the age
of 18. Stated is the sufficiency of the evidence to conclude that a
legal guardian other than Smith gave approval for the plural
marriage.</p>

<p>While he was not necessarily bound by Illinois law (they were not
legally recognized marriages), it appears that Smith fully respected the
law. The adherence to the law indicates an awareness of his present
social norms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be inferred that, because Smith was withing the
law, he was conscious of it and trying to keep it.</p>

<p>In the 1850 US Census, citizens were asked if they had gotten married
within the past year. Filtering everyone who said yes and who was female
will show a contemporary spread of marriage ages. If the ages of Smith’s
wives are significantly less than the norm, it may be concluded that
Smith disproportionately targeted young women. This, paired with any
other deviations in rends, could count towards evidence that Smith used
his power to acquire sexual satisfaction.</p>

<h4>Statistical Test and Conclusion</h4>
<p>Despite the antagonists claiming Smith targeted younger women,
because of the implications of the visualization and the table, the
hypothesis tested will be the opposite.</p>
<p>The assumption (<span class="math inline">\(H_o\)</span> or null
hypothesis) is that there will not be significant differences between
the averages (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> or mean) the two
group.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_o: \mu_\text{Avg Age of 1850 Wives} = \mu_\text{Avg Age of JS Plural

<p>The prediction (<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> or
alternative hypothesis) is that the average marriage age of 1850 women
is less that the average marriage age of Smith’s plural wives.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_a: \mu_\text{Avg Age of 1850 Wives} &lt; \mu_\text{Avg Age of JS

<p>A confidence level of 97.5% will be used, and thus a significance of
0.025 will be needed to accept the alternative hypothesis. A p value
below the significance (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt;

<p>The test statistic indicates that the female’s marriage ages in the
1850s sample mean are roughly 3.7 standard deviations less than mean of
the ages of Smith’s plural wives. This tells of a large difference in
the two groups. With the prediction that it would be smaller, P value
indicates that the probability of seeing such a difference is about
.0003384. This means our observed values are <em>highly</em>
improbable.</p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.025\)</span>, it appears
that, in stark contrast to the critic’s claims, there is sufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, in accepting the
alternative, it is realized that Smith’s plural wives were significantly
older than contemporary trends.</p>

<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">How do the age difference

<p>Taking the average age individuals of both sexes were married in
1850, we can compare this to the same in Smith’s marriages. If the
difference were significantly less than the societal norm, it would be
assumed that Smith was violating the norm consistently.</p>
<p>As a note, these values represent averages. While, on a case by
basis, deviation will likely be found, the comparison of the averages
will show how this fits across Smith’s entire range of marriages.</p>

<div id="graph-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Graph</h4>
<p>To approach an answer, the distributions will first be visualized

husband’s, so a positive values indicate an older husband and a negative
an older wife.</p>
<p><img src="Polyg_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The distributions seems slightly skewed, and it definitely appears as
though Smith trended toward having larger age gaps that within his
plural marriages than what was generally seen.</p>

<p>It would appear that, while the median is noticeable higher, the
average age difference is very similar. This differences of the means

than contemporary trends.</p>

<p>The test statistic indicates that the age differences in the 1850s
sample mean are roughly .15 standard deviations less than mean of
Smith’s age difference to his plural wives. This means that only a small
difference between the two groups is observed. The p value indicates
that the probability of seeing this is .44, which is fairly high.</p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.025\)</span>, we fail to

<div id="analysis-conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, across the six secondary questions asked, there is
only one instance of Smith departing from societal norms or having
questionable practices. This involved the fact that there is sufficient
evidence to conclude that Smith’s plural wives were, on average,
significantly older when married to Smith than would be expected.</p>
<p>Thus, I conclude that Smith did not use polygamy as a way to justify
and engage in questionable or inappropriate actions.</p>
<p>While the practice of polygamy in the United States was unusual then
and still is now, Smith seem to have stayed within the laws he set forth
as a religious leader, withing local customs, and within the trust of
those closest to him.</p>
