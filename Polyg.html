Polygamy</h1>

<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(a.k.a. LDS Church or the Church), I often hear criticism of my faith’s
theology and history. I typically suspend my acceptance of such claims
until I perform my own research. One of the more common attacks is
regarding the character of the Church’s founder, Joseph Smith. Smith
claimed that God commanded him to institute the practice of plural
marriage, meaning the marrying of more than one wife. He often comes
under fire for this, based on the assumption that a man wouldn’t have 35
wives unless he was after sex.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of LDS and Non-LDS historians, we have a pretty
good idea with what happened in most of these plural marriages. Using
this historical data, we can assess different questions about Joseph
Smith’s Polygamy. By doing so, I hope first and foremost to uncover the
truth. I have the firm hope that the truth will show that Smith was a
reputable man, free from hypocrisy and acting within his cultural
context. Should the evidence be sufficient to indicate sexual immorality
as defined by the LDS Church, the trustworthiness of the institution may
be called into question.</p>

Methodology</h2>
<div id="primary-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Primary Question</h3>
<p>The analysis will seek to answer the primary question:</p>
<p><strong>“Did Joseph Smith engage in questionable or inappropriate
actions through the practice of polygamy?”</strong></p>
<p>Six secondary questions will be analyzed through various visual and
summary measures. If appropriate an inferential statistical test will be
performed. When answering each question, Smith will be assumed innocent
(within the law, adhering to societal norms, etc.) until there is
sufficient evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>To control the family-wise error rate, the Bonferroni adjustment
adjustment will be made to the significance level.</p>

<div id="outline" class="section level3">
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>In pursuit of an answer to this question, the following secondary
questions will be asked :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#pedo">Are any of Joseph Smith’s sexual relations
consistent with pedophilia?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#emma">Did Smith hide sexual realtionships from his
first wife, Emma?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#type">What is the relationship between the type of
sealing and evidence of sexuality?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#law">Despite the illegality of polygamy, was Smith
otherwise within local marriage laws?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#age">How do the ages of his brides compare to
contemporary marriage trends?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#diff">How do the age difference between him and his
wives compare to contemporary trends?</a></p></li>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>Historical data such as the names, ages, and other factors was
sourced from the work of Brian Hales. Observational data including the
strength of any evidence of sexual relations were not the author’s, but
sourced from the work of Brian Hales. The author reviewed the primary
and secondary historical evidences to determine whether Emma Smith was
aware of the plural marriages. All data regarding Joseph Smith’s
Polygamy was sourced from the various pages on Brian Hales’ website, <a
href="josephsmithspolygamy.org">josephsmithspolygamy.org</a>.</p>
<p>Data used from the 1850 US census was retrieved from the IPUMS
database<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The data set used was a random sample of
census records totaling 1% of the US population surveyed. When
retrieving the data, the parameter was set to include the households
wherein at least one individual had been married within the last year.
This census data was the closest to the occurrences of Smith’s
marriages, most of which happened in the early 1840’s.</p>
<p>When determining whether or not Emma Smith was aware of the sealings.
The historical record indicates that she gave prior approval to several
of them. Other sources indicate that the plural wife, after the sealing,
proceeded to live with the Smiths and that Joseph spent nights with
them. Other times, it was indicated that Joseph would travel to visit
them shortly after their sealing, with the intention of the trip being
to celebrate the union. As such cases overlapped with Hales’ put forth
evidence of sexuality, It was taken or inferred that Emma Smith was
aware of the unions either prior to or shortly after they occurred.
Where the record does not contain sufficient evidence to persuade the
author that Emma did know, it is inferred that she did not.</p>

Polygamy.</p>

<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level3 tabset tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-fade">Data Wrangling</h3>
<p>In order to most accurately compare the data from the 1850 US Census
records and Smith’s plural marriages, the following steps were taken to
wrangle the data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Census data was filtered to only show each household that had
at least one person married within the last year, and the columns for
household ID, female age, and male age were selected</p></li>
<li><p>The data was pivoted to cause each row to contain the age data
from each household. Some households had 1, 3, or 4 individuals married
withing the last year in them. Unsure of what this indicated, the data
was filtered to ensure that only households with one recently married
female and one recently married male were included. It is assumed that
such households would only include recently married couples, and that
the ages recorded by the census are the ages those individuals were when
married.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the inferential statistical tests more accurate, the data
was also filtered at this stage to only include males ages 22 to 37. It
was within this range that Smith was sealed to each of his plural wives.
It is hoped that, by analyzing the data for contemporary males married
with the same 15 year span, the results of the tests will be more
accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>A new column was made in the census data that subtracted the
woman’s age from the man’s age. The same was done in the polygamy
dataset. Thus, a positive number indicate an older husband and a
negative number an older wife. A column that indicated which group was
represented was also added.</p></li>
<li><p>After ensuring the columns were selected and ordered the same,
the two data sets were combined to form one, with each row displaying
female age at marriage, male age at marriage, age difference (<span
class="math inline">\(\text{male age} - \text{female age}\)</span>), and
the group of origin.</p></li>

<h3>Defining Pedophilia</h3>
<p>Because one of the questions being asked regards Smith showing
pedophilic tendencies, the term will be defined. Dictionaries
contemporary to Smith do not have the term, therefore a modern
definition will be used. This analysis will not seek to officially
diagnose anyone with any mental disorders. Any conclusions regarding
such will be, at most, observations regarding trends in the historical
record. For purposes of the analysis, a synthesis of the definitions
provided by the American Psychological Association and the American
Psychiatric Association for pedophilia will be used as the strictest
definition.</p>
<p>According to the American Psychological Association, pedophilia is “a
paraphilia in which sexual acts or fantasies involving prepubertal
children are the persistently preferred or exclusive method of achieving
sexual excitement.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>” The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Health Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric
Association, adds that the sexual acts or fantasies are “with a
prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>”</p>
<p>Taking a looser definition based on these criteria, the established
definition of pedophilia for this analysis will be, “any stand-alone or
repeated sexual relations with an individual or individuals below the
age of sixteen.” The intention behind expanding this definition is to
fit the definition within the moral intuitions and sensibilities of the
broader public.</p>

Emma’s awareness of the relationships. This observation suggests that,

disclosed the ones which the historical record indicates likely involved
sexual relations.</p>

<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">What is the relationship
between the type of sealing and evidence of sexuality?</h3>
<p>Today in the LDS Church, the only sealings performed for the living
are time-and-eternity sealings. That is, a man and a wife are joined in
union for the rest of this life as well as in the next life. However, in
the early days of the church, this was not solely the case. Sealings
could be performed for time, time-and-eternity, or eternity.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div id="graph" class="section level4">
<h4>Graph</h4>
<p>Sealings involving time would be treated as legal marriages are, but
eternity-only sealings would not. Given the LDS Church’s consistency in
teaching that sexual relations be within marriage, evidence that Smith
engaged in sexual relations within eternity-only sealings would imply
hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The following graph will display the evidence of sexuality, grouped
by the types of sealings.</p>
<p><img src="Polyg_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As is evident from the graph, the sealings that displayed the most
evidence of sexual relations were time and eternity sealings. there are
no instances of moderate or high evidence of sexuality among other types
of sealings.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>As type of sealing and historical evidence of sexuality are
juxtaposed, it becomes clear that the only relationships with stronger
evidence of sexuality (moderate to strong) were those which were treated
as legal marriages. Thus, there is enough evidence to conclude that
Smith was not violating the principles he taught and enforced.</p>
<p>It is likely that Smith viewed Time and Eternity sealings as being
legitimate marriages. Thus, he did within those relationships what
married people do.</p>

<p>While he was not necessarily bound by Illinois law (they were not

will show a contemporary spread of marriage ages. If the ages of Smith’s

recently married to husbands between the ages of 22 and 27 is much lower
than the ages of Smith’s plural wives. The probability of seeing this

<p>The test statistic is -0.355. This indicates that the average age gap
in couples where the husband is between 22 and 27 is a little lower that
the average age gap in Smith’s plural marriages. The probability of
seeing this randomly is 0.7248, which is fairly high. That probability
value, being above the significance of 0.025, is insufficient evidence
to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no reason to believe that the age gaps
withing Smith’s marriages were in any way significantly higher or lower
than contemporary trends.</p>

<h2>Analysis Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, across the six secondary questions asked, there is
only one instance of Smith departing from societal norms or having
questionable practices. This involved the fact that there is sufficient
evidence to conclude that Smith’s plural wives were, on average,
significantly older when married to Smith than would be expected.</p>
<p>Thus, I conclude that Smith did not use polygamy as a way to justify
and engage in questionable or inappropriate actions.</p>
<p>While the practice of polygamy in the United States was unusual then
and still is now, Smith seem to have stayed within the laws he set forth
as a religious leader, within local customs, and within the trust of
those closest to him.</p>
